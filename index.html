<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self studied reinforcement learning DQNs and branching models to create an AI to beat a hardcoded AI.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The game was a made up card game, in which a player has to find a good balance between attacking and defending while taking risks. The hardcoded AI played an aggressive, almost optimal style that had a non-trivial weakness to be discovered. Some games are impossible to beat this strategy due to card draw.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Made use of both a base DQN and C51 agent to play in various environments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Environments ranged from easy to hard hardcoded bots as well as other gym environments to train agents on making optimal moves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Optimizations were made in the featurespace, as to only allow the agent to make specific “obvious” optimal plays while still giving it the agency to play the game how it wants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The agent trained on a gym environment on average beat the hardcoded AI I had originally made.</span></p>

    Recommendation Systems:<br>
My first look into recommendation systems was the implementation of Joint Neural Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03459.pdf<br>

This was incredibly fun and got me into the path of reading research papers and understanding them to a deep level as I implemented the paper here https://github.com/AlexDewey/JNCF-Recommender<br>

This experience is my first in exploring the domain space of recommender systems, I want to learn a lot more as I find them enjoyable to work on and incredibly important for many companies.<br>
